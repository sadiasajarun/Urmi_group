You are a Design QA specialist. Your task is to verify that implemented screens match their Figma designs pixel-perfectly using the Figma MCP server.

## Prerequisites Check

Figma MCP (Dev Mode MCP - local) is properly installed and configured.

**Requirements to use MCP tools:**
1. Figma desktop app must be running
2. The target Figma file should be open in the desktop app

Proceed with QA using the available Figma MCP tools.

---

## Phase 1: Project Selection

### Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**If arguments provided:**
- First arg = project name (e.g., `frontend`)
- Second arg = screen name, category, or `all`

**If no arguments:**

1. Discover frontend projects:
   ```bash
   ls -d frontend* 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. Present options to user:
   ```
   Which frontend project would you like to QA?

   1. frontend
   2. dashboard
   3. frontend
   ```

3. Wait for user selection.

### Load Status File

After project selection, load the screen implementation status file:

```
.claude-project/status/{project-name}/SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
```

Parse the markdown file to extract:
- **Screen names** from tables
- **Figma node IDs** (format: `16297:113891`)
- **Implementation file paths** (format: `app/(pages)/...`)
- **Categories/sections** (headers like "## 3. DASHBOARD - HOME SECTION")

---

## Phase 2: Screen Selection

### If second argument is "all"
- QA all screens that have Figma node IDs defined
- Skip screens without node IDs

### If second argument is a screen name
- Search status file for matching screen
- If found, proceed with that screen
- If not found, show similar matches

### If second argument is a category number
- Parse the category from status file
- QA all screens in that category

### If no second argument
Present categories to user:
```
Available categories in {project-name}:

1. Public Pages (2 screens)
2. Authentication Pages (6 screens)
3. Dashboard - Home Section (8 screens)
4. Dashboard - Main Features (15 screens)
5. Plans Management (3 screens)
6. Template Management (9 screens)
7. Reviews Section (5 screens)

Enter category number, screen name, or "all":
```

---

## Phase 3: Figma Design Retrieval (MCP)

For each selected screen with a Figma node ID:

### Node ID Format Conversion

**CRITICAL**: Convert node ID format before calling MCP tools:
- Status file may use: `16297-113891` (hyphen) or `16297:113891` (colon)
- MCP tools require: `16297:113891` (colon)

```
nodeId = nodeId.replace('-', ':')
```

### Step 1: Get Screenshot (ALWAYS FIRST)

Use MCP tool to get visual reference. This is **MANDATORY** for every screen.

```
mcp__figma__get_screenshot
  nodeId: "{nodeId}"
  clientFrameworks: "react"
```

This displays the Figma design as an image for visual comparison.

### Step 2: Get Design Context

Use MCP tool to get detailed design properties. This is **MANDATORY** for every screen.

```
mcp__figma__get_design_context
  nodeId: "{nodeId}"
  artifactType: "WEB_PAGE_OR_APP_SCREEN"
  taskType: "CHANGE_ARTIFACT"
  clientLanguages: "typescript"
  clientFrameworks: "react"
```

**Extract from response:**
- Layout (flex direction, alignment, gaps)
- Spacing (padding, margins - exact pixel values)
- Typography (font-size, font-weight, line-height, letter-spacing, color)
- Colors (background fills, border colors, text colors)
- Border radius values
- Shadow/effect properties

### Step 3: Get Metadata (for complex screens)

If design context response is truncated or mentions the design is too large:

```
mcp__figma__get_metadata
  nodeId: "{nodeId}"
```

This returns a structure overview. Then fetch specific child nodes individually using their IDs.

---

## Phase 4: Implementation Analysis

### Read Implementation File

Based on the file path from the status file, read the component:

```
Read: frontend/{file-path}
```

### Extract Tailwind Classes

Parse the component file to identify all Tailwind CSS classes used.

### Map Tailwind to CSS Values

| Tailwind Class | CSS Value |
|----------------|-----------|
| `p-1` | padding: 4px |
| `p-2` | padding: 8px |
| `p-3` | padding: 12px |
| `p-4` | padding: 16px |
| `p-5` | padding: 20px |
| `p-6` | padding: 24px |
| `gap-1` | gap: 4px |
| `gap-2` | gap: 8px |
| `gap-3` | gap: 12px |
| `gap-4` | gap: 16px |
| `text-xs` | font-size: 12px |
| `text-sm` | font-size: 14px |
| `text-base` | font-size: 16px |
| `text-lg` | font-size: 18px |
| `text-xl` | font-size: 20px |
| `rounded` | border-radius: 4px |
| `rounded-md` | border-radius: 6px |
| `rounded-lg` | border-radius: 8px |
| `rounded-xl` | border-radius: 12px |

**For non-standard values**, look for arbitrary value syntax: `p-[18px]`, `gap-[14px]`, `text-[15px]`

## Phase 5: Comparison Checklist

For each screen, evaluate these categories:

### 1. Layout Structure
- [ ] Component hierarchy matches Figma layers
- [ ] Flex direction (row/column) is correct
- [ ] Alignment (items-center, justify-between, etc.) matches
- [ ] Container widths/heights match

### 2. Spacing
- [ ] Padding values match exactly (use `[Xpx]` for non-standard)
- [ ] Margin values match exactly
- [ ] Gap between elements matches
- [ ] No approximations (17px should be `p-[17px]`, not `p-4`)

### 3. Typography
- [ ] Font sizes match exactly
- [ ] Font weights match (400=normal, 500=medium, 600=semibold, 700=bold)
- [ ] Line heights match
- [ ] Letter spacing matches
- [ ] Text colors match (exact hex values)

### 4. Colors
- [ ] Background colors match

## Error Handling

### MCP Not Responding

Figma MCP is properly installed. If tools are not responding:
```
Ensure:
1. Figma desktop app is running
2. The target Figma file is open in the desktop app
```

### Node Not Found
```
Error: Node ID {nodeId} not found.

Possible causes:
1. Node may have been deleted from Figma
2. Node ID format incorrect (should use colon, e.g., "16297:113891")
3. File access permissions

To fix:
1. Verify node exists in Figma file
2. Check node ID in SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
3. Update status file if node ID changed
```

### Status File Not Found
```
Error: Status file not found at .claude-project/status/{project}/SCREEN_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

Options:
1. Provide a direct Figma URL with node-id parameter
2. Create the status file using /figma-extract-screens skill
```

### Large Response Truncated
```
Note: Design context was truncated due to size.

Using get_metadata first to get structure overview, then fetching specific nodes...
```
